This software was built to compose original music using AI. It is a project I worked on over christmas of 2019.

The program uses a genetic algorithm to develop random notes into musically coherant melodies according to predefined rules of music theory. These rules are hardcoded, but the ability to change them is something I'd like to do eventually and kept in mind while building it.

You can listen to 10 melodies composed by this program here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-OXt77kBo&feature=youtu.be
